# Compiling
## Windows
Due to document length it is located separately [here](doc/compile_ms.md)

## Linux
### Simplest & quickest
```sh
sudo apt install build-essential libcurl4-openssl-dev
gcc -Wall cht.c -lcurl -o cht
sudo cp ./cht /usr/local/bin/ # "install" it
```
### Static & full under control
```sh
sudo apt install build-essential libcurl4-openssl-dev cmake
```
* download curl from https://curl.haxx.se/download.html,
* unpack it to src folder and rename folder to curl (do not leave it like curl-x.y.z)
```sh
cd curl
cmake -DCURL_STATICLIB=ON .
make libcurl # we need only this mudule
cd ..
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../src
make
sudo cp ./cht /usr/local/bin/ # "install" it
```
